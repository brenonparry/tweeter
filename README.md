# Tweeter Project

Shitter (formally 'tweeter') is a simple, single-page Twitter clone...or is it? 

What about the current internet-climate makes every user of every social platform think that their opinions and thoughts on literally everything that has ever happened or existed is worth its weight in gold and would be a tragedy if not vomited all over a screen? 

Enter: SHITTER.

A place for everyone's shit opinions that can be flushed into the overwhelming nothing of social media. Your co-workers thoughts on politics? FLUSH. Karen's oatmeal raisin cookie recipe? FLUSH. Your mom's sister parrot singing backstreet boys? F-L-U-S-H. You get the idea.
